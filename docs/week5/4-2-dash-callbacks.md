# 4.2. DASH: Unit testing callbacks

This is not required for the coursework but can be used to evidence a wider range of testing skills
and independent research.

Basic approach to unit testing callbacks is covered in
the [Dash documentation](https://dash.plotly.com/testing#unit-tests).

More advanced cases are covered in this blog
post, [Write unit tests for Dash callbacks](https://plotly.com/blog/building-unit-tests-for-dash-applications/).
