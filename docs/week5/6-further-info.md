## External tutorials
### Python playwright

- [Pytest with Eric's Playwright tutorial](https://pytest-with-eric.com/automation/pytest-playwright/).

### Dash with Selenium Webdriver

- [Building unit tests for dash applications](https://plotly.com/blog/building-unit-tests-for-dash-applications/).
  This goes beyond what is expected for the coursework and tests callbacks and uses mocks. Useful if
  you want to expand your knowledge.
- [Plotly Dash Testing official documentation](https://dash.plotly.com/testing)
- Dash have [tests for their code in GitHub](https://github.com/plotly/dash/tree/dev/tests). It can
  be useful to see how they structure their own tests.
- [Sean McCarthy's Dash testing tutorial](https://mccarthysean.dev/005-03-Dash-Testing). He uses the
  `dash_thread_server` and `dash_br` fixtures rather than `dash_duo`. Includes examples of different
  ways to select elements on the page for testing.
